Students should review the sample papers on the [course website](https://hksung.github.io/Fall25_LING351/materials/), sign up on the [shared slidesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1on8icHoXUsj74m1UNEHk8CycHEAmVH1nRsUatpn9xYc/edit?usp=sharing), and consult with me if they wish to choose articles outside the list. I will form groups of 2â€“3 based on these selections. Further details will be provided in class on Tuesday (9/16).
